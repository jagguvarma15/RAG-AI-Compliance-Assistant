well as through additional firms on terms and conditions that                   it selects in its sole discretion, provided that no such sales                   shall take place within the NPO Marketplace.

Schoolpop shall have the exclusive right to resell Cards in                   the NPO Marketplace.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   "Guaranteed Minimum") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace.

This Agreement (a) may not be assigned by Seller without the written          consent of AEIS, except to an entity controlling, controlled by or          under common control with Seller, provided, however, Schoolpop shall          remain liable for the obligations contained herein including the          attachments and Exhibits thereto, and (b) may be modified only by an          agreement in writing signed on behalf of AEIS by an executive officer.

No right or interest in this Agreement shall be assigned by                   Schoolpop without prior written permission of AEIS, which                   shall not be unreasonably withheld.

In any consecutive three (3) month period in which the                   difference between the Card Inventory Forecast less the actual                   Card Order volume for that period is a shortage of ten percent                   or greater (10%+), AEIS reserves the right to assess a                   penalty, ("Card Inventory Penalty") of sixteen and one-half                   cents ($0.165) per Card for such difference as detailed in                   Examples 1 and 2 below.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Schoolpop                   shall fund from AEIS a minimum of $52,000,000 of Cards (the                   "Guaranteed Minimum") in each Contract Year in order to                   maintain the exclusive right to sell Cards in the NPO                   Marketplace.

This limit                 &sbsp; shall consist of a maximum Card value of $1,500,000 in                   Encompass(R) Select Cards and $1,500,000 Card value in any                   other product (s).

At any given time during this Agreement, Schoolpop's inactive                   Card inventory shall be limited to $3,000,000 in Card value as                   determined by the Point denomination on each Card.

In the event                   that Schoolpop exceeds either of these limits, AEIS shall                   cease fulfilling Orders from Schoolpop until such time that                   Schoolpop's inventory returns to an acceptable level based on                   the established maximums.

Effective January 1, 2005, after which                   Encompass(R) Select shall no longer be available to Schoolpop,                   the maximum inactive Card value shall not exceed $3,000,000 in                   any combination of products at any given time.

From the Effective Date through September 30, 2004, Schoolpop                   may order non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations                   (other than 25, 50, 75, and 100 Points) up to a maximum of 200                   Points.

Upon termination of this Agreement, Schoolpop shall have the                   right to continue to sell any Cards in its possession for a                   period of three (3) months following the effective date of                   termination, subject to compliance with the applicable terms                   and conditions set forth herein, provided however, that                   termination of the Agreement is not due to a breach of                   representation or warranty of the Agreement by Schoolpop in                   which case Schoolpop shall discontinue selling Cards                   immediately upon termination.

AEIS and/or their appointed representatives of AEIS or                   American Express Travel Related Services Inc. as solely                   determined by AEIS, shall be entitled to inspect and approve                   Seller's safekeeping facilities at any time during normal                   business hours.

NICE agrees to           conduct the audits in a reasonable manner so as not to cause undue           disruption to Contractor's provision of the Manufacturing Outsourcing           Services and such audits shall be conducted during business hours, and           shall be coordinated with Contractor.

NICE shall have the rights to conduct audits of the           Manufacturing Outsourcing Services and related facilities, systems,           and records as set forth in this Section 10 for the purpose of           auditing Contractor's compliance with the provisions of this           Agreement, all subject to the limitations below.

As part of the Manufacturing           Outsourcing Services, Contractor shall (1) retain records and           supporting documentation detailed in Section 10.2 above if and to the           extent such record retention is required by tax or similar           authorities, and/or exists in the ERP system, and/or is common           practice in the industry, including but not limited to - production           files for the following periods: 7 years for records required by tax           or similar authorities and ERP data, 3 years for production files,           otherwise as required by law or as is the common practice, and (2)           upon notice of no less than five (5) Days from NICE, provide NICE and           its designees with reasonable access to such records and documentation           for the purpose of conducting NICE' business and reporting.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, NICE'           liability to Contractor for any indirect, special, incidental,           exemplary or consequential damages as a result of any claim arising           under this Agreement or in connection therewith, regardless of whether           NICE has been advised of the possibility of such damages, shall not           exceed five million US dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate for all           claims, except for infringement of Intellectual Property rights for           which NICE is liable under Section 12.8.

In any event, the total liquidated damages                     as per this Section shall not exceed 5% of the Product                     Price.

In the event that following the delay, Contractor is in                     compliance with the Due Dates for two immediately                     consecutive Quarters and there is no delay whatsoever,                     Contractor will be reimbursed by NICE for liquidated damages                     already paid for delay in the previous Quarter (before the                     said 2 Quarters), if paid, without derogating from the                     previous delay being regarded as a breach hereunder.

In any event, the total liquidated damages                     as per this Section shall not exceed 5% of the Product                     Price.

Any delay from the Due Date of a certain                Product in a certain Quarter, not due to a specific written                request by NICE or otherwise deriving from a breach of NICE'                undertakings hereunder and only to the extent deriving from such                breach by NICE, or caused by an event of Force Majeure, and                subject to the terms hereof, shall be considered a material                breach of Contractor's obligations under this Agreement and shall                entitle NICE to the following liquidated damages in addition to                any remedy available to NICE under this Agreement or by law:

If such Standard Cost methodology change results in an increase of Facility Conversion Cost for Products manufactured for Customer of more than two percent (2%), then Manufacturer shall revert to the former methodology for purposes of the calculation of Price during such Fiscal Year.

In the event that Price is adjusted as a result of a change to Facility Conversion Cost under Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Threshold for all remaining Fiscal Years in the Initial Term (or Extension Periods as appropriate) will be reduced such that if Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year are estimated to be (a) less -28-

For example: if during the month of March 2010 (a) (A) above was 2,000 TRx and (B) above was $36.50 then MBRK  would be remit $36,500.00 to DD.

OR

(b) the following formula for the period from October 1, 2010 through termination of this Agreement:

  (A)   the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by:      (B)   the applicable Gross Margin Per TRx multiplied by:      (C)   50%.

  (A)   the Actual DD Target Segment MOXATAG TRx Tablets for the Promotional Measurement Period multiplied by:      (B)   the applicable Gross Margin Per Tablet multiplied by:      (C)   50%.

In the event DD retains the service of a third party to perform any of DD's obligations hereunder DD shall, prior to  commencement of any work by such third party, obtain the third party's written acknowledgement that all work done by  such third party shall be deemed "work made for hire" and that the copyright in such material shall rest and remain with  MBRK, or secure from such third party written assignment of all right, title and interest in and to the copyright in any  material created by such third party.

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, DD hereby  sells, assigns and transfers to MBRK and MBRK shall be the exclusive owner, assignee, and transferee of the entire  right, title and interest, including all renewals for the entire world, in and to all work performed and work product  developed or produced under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, materials (including Promotional Materials),  writings, documents or other information conceived or reduced to practice or

DD shall also make its records and other documents relevant to MBRK and  this Agreement available for audit or review by MBRK upon MBRK's request at a mutually agreed upon time.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, UNDER  ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND,  SUFFERED BY OR OTHERWISE COMPENSABLE TO SUCH OTHER PARTY, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH.

Vendor will cooperate, and will ensure that its Subcontractors cooperate, in the AT&T Audits, and will make the information reasonably required to conduct the AT&T Audits available on a timely basis.

Prior to Location Acceptance, Vendor shall provide AT&T escorted access to the premises wherein all such material is located and, following Location Acceptance, AT&T shall have access to the premises wherein all such material is located pursuant to the terms of the Master License Agreement and the applicable Site License thereunder or any third party Tower Lease, as applicable.

AT&T's access to the records and other supporting documentation shall include the right to inspect and photocopy Vendor's documentation and the documentation of its Subcontractors as provided to Vendor, and the right to retain copies thereof outside of their physical location with appropriate safeguards, if such retention is deemed reasonably necessary by AT&T and only to the extent that all such records are maintained by AT&T in accordance with Section 3.16 hereof.

AT&T may inspect and inventory the material furnished by AT&T under this Agreement during Vendor's normal business hours.

Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor's cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection.

(ii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T's request and at AT&T's expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T. If AT&T's request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T's good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T's account, and the audit in both Parties' opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor's audit of its Subcontractor.

(iii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review. To the extent AT&T deems it reasonably necessary to require such access, then Vendor will renegotiate its contract with the applicable Subcontractor in order to obtain the audit rights described in Subsection (b) above.

Vendor will provide AT&T, at AT&T's request and cost, with paper and electronic copies of documents and information reasonably necessary to verify Vendor's compliance with this Agreement.

Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T's request and at AT&T's expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T

Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation

If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three (3) miles of the Unit,  and/or  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit.

Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase.

In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%).

If Franchisee desires to assign his rights under the Franchise to a new franchisee,  Franchisee  (Assignor of the  Franchise),  agrees to pay to Pretzel Time a transfer  fee equal to the  greater of SIX  THOUSAND  TWO  HUNDRED  FIFTY DOLLARS  ($6,250.00) or the then current  transfer fee being paid by franchisees upon the assignment, gift, bequeath or transfer of ownership of the Franchise to cover administrative costs and expenses.

Franchisee shall                   furnish  Pretzel  Time at the  time of the  execution  of this                   Agreement or of assignment to the  corporation  or partners of                   Franchisee, a written agreement stating that no stockholder or                   partner  will  sell,  assign  or  transfer  voluntarily  or by                   operation  of law  any  securities  of  Franchisee,  or  other                   ownership  interest  in  Franchisee,  to any  person or entity                   other than existing shareholders or partnership, to the extent                   permitted  hereunder,  without  the prior  written  consent of                   Pretzel Time.

Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.

No assignment by either Party of any rights, including rights to money due or to become due under this Agreement, or delegation of any duties under this Agreement or under any purchase orders subject to this Agreement, shall be binding on the nonassigning Party unless and until a written consent has been obtained from the nonassigning Party.

Distributor shall not sell or otherwise transfer any of the rights granted pursuant to this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of Vendor; provided, however, Distributor may enter into distribution arrangements with regional distributors within the Territory in its efforts to promote, advertise and distribute the Products in accordance with this Agreement;

Subject to the mutual agreement of Vendor and Distributor, in the event that Vendor provides a new sales lead to Distributor that results in the sale of the Products, Distributor shall pay to Vendor a commission equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross profit for the Products, where gross profit shall mean the difference between the price paid by the customer (where Distributor will determine the customer price for the Products on a case by case basis) and the price paid by Distributor for the Products.

In the event of the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, the exclusive distribution right and license granted to Distributor pursuant to this Agreement shall automatically revert to Vendor as Vendor's sole property.

As part of the exclusive distribution right granted in this Section 2, Vendor hereby grants Distributor the non- exclusive, non-transferable right to use and display Vendor's trademarks, logos, Product photographs and images, Product advertising and promotional copy, including but not limited to the materials contained in Vendor's website, in connection with the promotion, advertising and distribution of the Products.

As part of the exclusive distribution right granted in this Section 2, Vendor hereby grants Distributor the non- exclusive, non-transferable right to use and display Vendor's trademarks, logos, Product photographs and images, Product advertising and promotional copy, including but not limited to the materials contained in Vendor's website, in connection with the promotion, advertising and distribution of the Products.

Distributor agrees not to use in any manner whatsoever the marks, logos, images and copy of Vendor following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, except as may be needed to sell any Products remaining in Distributor's inventory.

The Monthly Compensation shall be paid for the remaining monthly periods remaining in the Term, as if the termination of this Agreement had not occurred, or twenty four (24) calendar months, which ever period is less, where payment shall be made no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the end of the relevant monthly period.

In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either Section 1.1.4 or 1.1.5 of this Agreement, this shall not of itself be deemed a breach hereof but Distributor shall have the right to receive monthly compensation from Vendor, or successor to the Vendor, representing the amount of profit to Distributor lost as a result of the termination (the "Monthly Compensation").

Distributor shall not be liable for any losses or damages incurred by Vendor as a result of Distributor's failure to meet its obligations under Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

Neither party shall be liable to the other for lost profits or indirect, special consequential or punitive damages of any kind arising in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of the products, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Vendor will provide an initial supply of spare Products and parts as Distributor may reasonably required in accordance with Sections 8 and 10.3 to permit Distributor to offer a six-month warranty on the Products to customers and to enable Distributor to provide a warranty service to customers

Distributor may, no later than one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after a Product is sold by Distributor to a customer, return to Vendor, at Distributor's expense, any Product received by Distributor from Vendor during the 120-day period prior to such return, which Distributor or its customer believes to be defective.

Although Vendor intends to provide a six-month limited warranty to the end user, Distributor shall make no warranties or representations with respect to the Products on behalf of Vendor

SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT

Client

Excite

CyberShop

Excite, Inc.

31st day of March, 1998

31st day of March, 1998

In the event that Excite has not delivered XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX             clickthroughs to the Client Site by the end of twelve (12) months             after the Launch Date, the first year of the term of the Agreement             will be extended without additional sponsorship and advertising fees             for up to an additional four (4) months.

The term of this Agreement will begin on the Launch Date and will             not end until Excite displays of a total of XXXXXXXXXXXXX             impressions of Client's advertising banners and promotional             placements on the Excite Site and Excite has made reasonable             commercial efforts to deliver, at minimum, a goal of XXXXXXXX             clickthroughs to the Client Site.

Regardless of Excite's actual             delivery of impressions and clickthroughs, the term of this             Agreement will not be shorter than two (2) years after the display             of the first of Client's advertising banners and promotional             placements, subject to the termination rights set forth below.

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in             accordance with the laws of the State of New York, notwithstanding             the actual state or country of residence or incorporation of Excite             or Client.

Excite will in "good faith" ensure Client that the above mentioned             banners and promotional placements will be more prominently             presented than any other "competitive retailer's" banners or             promotional placements for the term of the Agreement. For the             purposes of this Agreement, a "competitive retailer" means an             on-line department store comparable to Bloomingdale's, Macy's,             Burdine's, Shopping.com, Chef's Catalog or iQVC.

Any attempt to assign this             Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and void.

Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in             part, without the other party's written consent (which will not be             unreasonably withheld), except that no such consent will be required             in connection with (i) a merger, reorganization or sale of all, or             substantially all, of such party's assets or (ii) either party's             assignment and/or delegation of its rights and responsibilities             hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary or joint venture in which the             assigning party holds an interest.

Separate and apart from the sponsorship and advertising fees paid             for the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX detailed above in Sections 7(a)             and 7(b), Client will pay Excite a variable revenue share to be             calculated based on sales, excluding any and all amounts collected             for sales tax, shipping and handling charges, and credits for             returned goods and/or services, Client derives from visits to the             Client Site via links from the promotional placements and             advertising on the Excite Site described in Sections 1 - 5.

The term of this Agreement will begin on the Launch Date and will             not end until Excite displays of a total of XXXXXXXXXXXXX             impressions of Client's advertising banners and promotional             placements on the Excite Site and Excite has made reasonable             commercial efforts to deliver, at minimum, a goal of XXXXXXXX             clickthroughs to the Client Site.

In the event that Excite has not delivered XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX             clickthroughs to the Client Site by the end of twelve (12) months             after the Launch Date, the first year of the term of the Agreement             will be extended without additional sponsorship and advertising fees             for up to an additional four (4) months.

In the event that Excite             has not delivered XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX clickthroughs to the Client





            Site by end of the additional four-month period, Client may             terminate this Agreement immediately upon delivery of written notice             to Excite.

c)    Each party hereby grants to the other a non-exclusive, limited             license to use its trademarks, service marks or trade names only as             specifically described in this Agreement.

In addition, Excite may, upon no less             than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Client, cause an             independent Certified Public Accountant to inspect the records of             Client reasonably related to the calculation of such payments during             Client's normal business hours.

Should             these results differ to those provided by Client's server by more             than 10%, Client may, once per quarter during Excite's regular             business hours and at Client's sole expense, review these records to             verify the accuracy and appropriate accounting of XXXXXXXXX             delivered pursuant to the Agreement.

EXCEPT UNDER SECTIONS 13(a) AND 13(b), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY             BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL             DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED             OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR             DAMAGES OR ALLEGED DAMAGES HEREUNDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR             ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO, AND WILL NOT EXCEED, THE             AMOUNTS TO BE PAID BY CLIENT TO EXCITE HEREUNDER.

Pey Dirt

May 31, 1999

"Contract Period" shall mean that period of time commencing as of May 31, 1999 and concluding May 31, 2000.

"Contract Period" shall mean that period of time commencing as of May 31, 1999 and concluding May 31, 2000.

This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the law of Tennessee.

If, at any time during the Contract Period, Company shall enter into any agreement (the terms of what are significantly the same as the terms hereof) in connection with the production and sale of Company's products using the name, likeness, photographic representation or signature of any other National Football League quarterback (active or retired), which agreement provides for the payment to such individual of remuneration in excess of that set forth herein, then Company agrees it will immediately so notify Pey Dirt

and, at the same time, shall, retroactive to the effective date of such other agreement, increase the rate of remuneration paid to Pey Dirt hereunder up to the highest then-current rate paid by Company to any such National Football League quarterback (active or retired) for a regional endorsement deal.

Pey Dirt grants to Company the exclusive right and license to use Manning Identification within the Contract Territory during the Contract Period in connection with the advertisement and promotion by Company of Products in television, radio, print and point of purchase.

Pey Dirt expressly agrees that the right to use Manning Identification will not be granted to anyone other than Company for use within the Contract Territory during the Contract Period in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale of Products.

In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Pey Dirt shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days after Pey Dirt has received notice of such merger or consolidation.

The rights granted Company hereunder shall be used only by it and shall not, without the prior written consent of Pey Dirt, be transferred or assigned to any other.

In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Pey Dirt shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days after Pey Dirt has received notice of such merger or consolidation.

Within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of each Contract Year Quarter, Company shall deliver to Pey Dirt an itemized statement setting forth the total shipments of Endorsed Products during said Contract Year Quarter and, at the same time, shall pay to Pey Dirt a royalty with respect to such shipments as hereinafter provided.

In addition to the royalty payments set forth above, Company agrees to grant Pey Dirt an option to purchase an aggregate of 50,000 shares of Company's publicly traded and registered stock (the "Shares") at an exercise price of $0.15 per share (the "Option"), which Option shall vest and become unrestricted when the SEC declares Company's registration statement effective (anticipated to be no later than November 30, 1999) and shall be exercisable until June 30, 2004.

Such royalties shall be based upon the actual invoice price of such shipments, exclusive only of shipping charges and sales taxes, and shall be at the rate of 8.5% of the total of said invoice prices with a minimum invoice price of $2.50 per box.

Further, Pey Dirt will be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of all gross profits (i.e., gross revenues less only Company's actual out-of-pocket costs of obtaining the raw merchandise) generated from merchandise related to the Endorsed Products and/or the Manning Identification, said merchandise to be advertised exclusively on the back panel of each box of Endorsed Products.

Pey Dirt has the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if Company's Endorsed Products are not being distributed in the Contract Territory to a significant number of stores by October 1, 1999.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Company shall not have the right to distribute photographs of Manning which are larger than 5" x 7".

Pey Dirt grants to Company the exclusive right and license to use Manning Identification within the Contract Territory during the Contract Period in connection with the advertisement and promotion by Company of Products in television, radio, print and point of purchase.

Upon registration of any such trademark, Pey Dirt shall grant to Company a license for the use of such registered trademark on or in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale of Endorsed Products, which license shall be coextensive and coterminous with the rights granted thereunder with respect to Manning Identification and shall require no increase in the payments set forth but shall contain such additional provisions as Pey Dirt reasonably believes are necessary for the protection of such trademark registered in the name of Manning or Pey Dirt.

Pey Dirt also grants to Company, subject to all of the terms and conditions herein, the non-exclusive right to use the Manning Identification in connection with certain merchandise that may be featured on the back panel of the Endorsed Products packaging, said merchandise to be subject to Pey Dirt's sole and exclusive discretion and approval.

Any Endorsed Products that may have been manufactured by or for Company prior to the termination or expiration of the Contract Period may be sold by Company during the ninety (90) day period next following the date of termination or expiration; provided, however, that Company shall have no such rights unless (a) Company is not in default of any of its obligations hereunder on the date of termination or expiration, (b) within fifteen (15) days after the date of termination or expiration, Company shall furnish to Pey Dirt a written statement of the number and description of Endorsed Products actually in stock on the date of termination or expiration, (c) the quantity of Endorsed Products in stock on the date of termination or expiration is not in excess of a reasonable inventory based upon Company's selling requirements of Endorsed Products during the Contract Period, (d) Company shall continue to pay to Pey Dirt with respect to such sales a royalty at the rates specified herein, and (e) royalties payable pursuant to this section shall be paid within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month with respect





to shipments made during such month.

Pey Dirt, or its representatives, shall, upon two weeks' written notice, have the right at all reasonable times (prior to the expiration of two (2) years after the termination of the Contract Period) to inspect and make copies of the books and records of Company insofar as they shall relate to the computation of royalties to be paid to Pey Dirt hereunder and the shipment of Endorsed Products pursuant to this Agreement.

In the event that any such inspections show an underreporting and underpayment in excess of five percent (5%) for any twelve (12) month period, then Company shall pay the cost of such examination.

Under no circumstances will Manning or Pey Dirt, on the one hand, or Company, on the other hand, be liable to the other or any other entity for any special, consequential, indirect, exemplary and/or punitive damages, or for loss of good will or business profits.

In no event (including, but not limited to, Manning's or Pey Dirt's default hereunder) shall Manning or Pey Dirt be liable to Company (or any entity claiming through Company) for any amount in excess of the amounts of royalties actually received by Pey Dirt hereunder, excluding the reimbursement of expenses.

Company agrees to provide and maintain, at its own expense, general liability insurance and product liability insurance with limits no less than $3,000,000 and within thirty (30) days from the date hereof, Company will submit to Pey Dirt a fully paid policy or certificate of insurance naming Pey Dirt, Pey Dirt's agent and Manning as additional insured parties, requiring that the insurer shall not terminate or materially modify such without written notice to Pey Dirt at least twenty (20) days in advance thereof.

June 11, 2015

The Agreement shall continue through the project's in-service date and for a period of fifteen (15) years after the project's in-service date ("Initial Term").

This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an "Extension Period") unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period.

This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, an "Extension Period") unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period.

This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio, without recourse to any principles of law governing conflicts of law, which might otherwise be applicable.

Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a default by Shipper, pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement or any other termination of this Agreement initiated by Shipper pursuant to Section 5, Shipper shall have the right to require MPL to enter into a new transportation service agreement with Shipper that (a) is consistent with the terms and objectives set forth in this Agreement and (b) has commercial terms that are, in the aggregate, equal to or more favorable to Shipper than fair market value terms as would be agreed by similarly-situated parties negotiating at arm's length provided.

If MPL is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Shipper decides to terminate this Agreement after the Effective Date but prior to the commencement of transportation service on the Pipeline, Shipper shall notify MPL of its decision to terminate within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date to allow MPL the opportunity to provide Shipper's unwanted capacity to other interested shippers as Unsubscribed Capacity as set forth in Section 3.8.

In the event that, pursuant to this first right, MPL receives binding commitments for volumes that exceed the expansion capacity available for committed volumes, each Shipper that submitted a binding commitment pursuant to this first right procedure shall be allocated the lesser of: (i) its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment, or (ii) the Shipper's pro-rata share of the expansion capacity available for committed volumes, which shall be calculated by multiplying (1) the Shipper's Proportionate Share, times (2) the expansion capacity available for committed volumes ("Expansion Volume Commitment").

To the extent permitted by Governmental Authorities, MPL will provide to each Shipper a first right, on terms and conditions specified by MPL that is consistent with this first right, to submit a binding nomination to ship, or otherwise pay for, a committed volume of Product on the expansion capacity ("Requested Expansion Volume Commitment").

No later than sixty (60) days following the date of MPL's Expansion Notice, Shipper must commit to, in a form acceptable to MPL in MPL's sole discretion, its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment ("Election Deadline").

other Party pursuant to Section 8.1.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the rights and obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such Party without the prior written consent of the

Neither Party may assign its rights under this Agreement without prior written consent from the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that either Party may assign its rights under this Agreement to a successor in interest resulting from any merger, reorganization, consolidation or as part of a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.

Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, if the volume of each Product shipped by Shipper on the Pipeline during the Quarter is less than the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product then, in addition to paying any amounts incurred by Shipper pursuant to Section 3.4 with respect to Shipper Deliveries for such Quarter, Shipper shall also pay MPL a deficiency payment (the "Quarterly Deficiency Payment"); equal to the product of:

(a) the difference between the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product for such Quarter and the volume of Shipper Deliveries of that Product on the Pipeline for such Quarter (the "Deficiency Volume"); and

(b) the applicable Tariff Rate for that Product for such Quarter.

If Shipper makes a Pre-Service Increase Request, MPL shall notify Shipper of its new Quarterly Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following receipt of Shipper's Pre-Service Increase Request, and Exhibit C shall be deemed revised to reflect Shipper's new volume commitment, which shall equal the sum of its original Capacity Request Form volume commitment and its Pre-Service Increase Request or its allocated portion thereof pursuant to this Section 3.9.

Shipper guarantees that during each Contract Year, Shipper will meet its Quarterly Volume Commitment or, in the event it fails to do so, shall remit to MPL the Quarterly Deficiency Payment pursuant to Section 3.5.

The amount of expansion capacity available for volume commitments pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the total expansion capacity.

If, during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment requirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable to MPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.5, in the event of any breach of a term or condition of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party's remedy shall be limited to the direct damages caused thereby and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, indirect, pecuniary, punitive, or economic damages, howsoever caused.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.5, in the event of any breach of a term or condition of this Agreement by either Party, the other Party's remedy shall be limited to the direct damages caused thereby and in no event shall a Party be liable to the other Party for any consequential, indirect, pecuniary, punitive, or economic damages, howsoever caused.

If Shipper fails to notify MPL within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the Project's in-service date or if MPL is unsuccessful in obtaining additional volume commitments as provided for in Section 3.8 to

fully replace Shipper's original volume commitment as submitted in its Capacity Request Form in Exhibit C, Shipper will reimburse MPL for Shipper's pro rata portion of actual and committed Construction Costs, plus, an administrative fee of ten (10) percent of said costs (such reimbursement is hereinafter referred to as the "Construction Cost Reimbursement").

The Parties agree that the Construction Cost Reimbursement shall be deemed liquidated damages and that such amount shall not be deemed a penalty, but rather represents a reasonable amount of liquidated damages in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by Shipper's termination of this Agreement as stated, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non- feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and that the payment of such amount shall be MPL's sole and exclusive remedy for such termination by Shipper.

Accordingly, either Party may terminate this Agreement or all/part of a Project for any reason and at any time upon giving the other Party sixty (60) days prior written notice.

JHU

The Johns Hopkins University

Company

May 3, 2016

"EFFECTIVE DATE" of this Agreement shall mean the date the last party hereto has executed this Agreement.

5/11/2016

This term of this Agreement shall commence on the EFFECTIVE DATE and shall continue, in each country, until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent within PATENT RIGHT(S) in that country.

This Agreement shall be construed, and legal relations between the parties hereto shall be determined, in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to contracts solely executed and wholly to be performed within the State of Maryland without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.

Company may terminate this Agreement and the license granted herein, for any reason, upon giving JHU sixty (60) days written notice under Paragraph 8.1.

If COMPANY proposes to sell any equity securities or securities that are convertible into equity securities of COMPANY (collectively, "Equity Securities") in any new round of financing, then COMPANY shall offer JHU and/or its Assignee (as defined below) an opportunity to purchase either: (i) up to that portion of the Equity Securities that equals JHU's then current, fully-diluted percentage ownership interest in COMPANY, or (ii) if the percentage offered for sale by COMPANY is less, then up to five percent (5%) of the Equity Securities offered for sale.

COMPANY will pay JHU a fee equal one percent (1%) of the Aggregate Consideration received by the COMPANY, or the total amount received by stockholders of COMPANY, upon the occurrence of a Liquidity Event.

For a Liquidity Event, the fee required under Section 4.1 of this Exhibit A above shall be payable to JHU by COMPANY in the same form as the proceeds paid or payable to either COMPANY or its security holders, whether in cash, securities or other property, and in the same proportion as such form of consideration is paid or payable to COMPANY or its security holders.

uch fee shall be paid after only the first to occur of either a Liquidation Event or an Initial Public Offering. The respective fees, when and if payable, shall be paid upon closing; except that if there are additional contingent amounts ("Trailing Consideration") payable upon the occurrence of subsequent events, then the Trailing Consideration shall be due and payable to JHU within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof by COMPANY.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the form of consideration paid or payable includes securities for which there is not an active public market, in lieu of paying that portion of the fee with such securities COMPANY will make a cash payment to JHU equal to the fair market value of such securities.

Company shall not sublicense to others under this Agreement, nor extend the rights granted hereunder to any affiliated company.

This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of JHU, its successors and assignees and shall not be assignable to another party, except that the Company shall have the right to assign this Agreement to another party in the case of the sale or transfer by the Company of all, or substantially all, of its assets relating to the LICENSED PRODUCT(S), LICENSED SERVICE(S) or PATENT RIGHT(S), to that party.

The stock purchase agreement shall contain provisions protecting JHU against dilution of its equity interest in the event the post-money valuation of any equity investment is less than two million dollars ($2,000,000), and it will also contain a provision for the piggy-back registration of common shares with any other class of stock in an initial public offering. If COMPANY proposes to sell any equity securities or securities that are convertible into equity securities of COMPANY (collectively, "Equity Securities") in any new round of financing, then COMPANY shall offer JHU and/or its Assignee (as defined below) an opportunity to purchase either: (i) up to that portion of the Equity Securities that equals JHU's then current, fully-diluted percentage ownership interest in COMPANY, or (ii) if the percentage offered for sale by COMPANY is less, then up to five percent (5%) of the Equity Securities offered for sale. Such offer to purchase shall be on the same terms and conditions as are offered with respect to such Equity Securities sold in such financing. For purposes of this section 7 of Exhibit A, the term "Assignee" means: (a) any entity to which JHU's preemptive rights have been assigned either by JHU or by another entity, or (b) any entity that is controlled by JHU.

Company shall pay to JHU, a running royalty as set forth in Exhibit A, for each LICENSED PRODUCT(S) sold and each LICENSED SERVICE(S) provided, based upon NET SALES and NET SERVICE REVENUES respectively, for the term of this Agreement.

If COMPANY is required to pay running royalties on any patent rights not licensed hereunder ("Other Royalties") in order to make, use or sell a particular LICENSED PRODUCT or LICENSED SERVICE, COMPANY shall be entitled to credit half (50%) of such Other Royalties against the Earned Royalty due, but the Earned Royalties shall not be reduced below fifty percent (50%) of those that would otherwise be due JHU for that LICENSED PRODUCT or LICENSED SERVICE.

COMPANY shall pay an annual EARNED ROYALTY as follows: 2.1.1 Four percent (4%) of the sum of NET REVENUES.

In addition, COMPANY shall issue to JHU that number of shares of common stock representing five percent (5%) of the outstanding common and preferred shares on a fully diluted basis of COMPANY pursuant to an agreed upon stock purchase agreement between COMPANY and JHU.

Company shall pay to JHU minimum annual royalties as set forth in Exhibit A.

As consideration for JHU's grant of a License to Company under this Agreement, Company shall pay to JHU a license fee, cash and equity, as set forth in Exhibit A within thirty (30) days of the EFFECTIVE DATE.

The minimum annual royalties pursuant to the Agreement are: 1st anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE and each subsequent anniversary of the EFFECTIVE DATE during the term: Three-thousand dollars ($3000)

The foregoing shall not preclude either party from employing any such employee (a) who seeks employment with the other party in response to any general advertisement or solicitation that is not specifically directed towards employees of such party or (b) who contacts the other party on his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by such party.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Metavante's maximum liability with respect to any Professional Services performed shall be limited to the value of the Professional Services engagement giving rise to the claim for Damages.

The Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the Estimated Remaining Value as set forth below.

For example, if the Customer chose to terminate for convenience on an agreement with a Commencement Date of January 01, 2007 and provided written notice on July 15, 2009 for a termination date of January 15, 2010, the Estimated Remaining Value would be the average monthly fee during 2009 multiplied by 47 and the Termination Fee would be the Estimated Remaining Value.

Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.

The parties acknowledge that the foregoing payments constitute reasonable and commercial liquidated damages.

If the Commencement Date does not occur on or before such date (the "Scheduled Conversion Date") solely as a result of Metavante's failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or the Conversion Plan (including the satisfactory completion of the identified Enhancements) and not as a result of any failure by Customer or any Third Party, Customer shall recover liquidated damages equal to the following:

  1.   Metavante shall pay Customer $10,000.00 for each month or portion thereof that Metavante fails to have the Commencement Date occur on the Scheduled Conversion Date provided that such amount shall be prorated for any partial month. Metavante will establish a new Scheduled Conversion Date if the above date is missed, subject to Customer's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Customer may elect to terminate this Agreement for any reason upon six months written notice to Metavante, provided Customer shall pay Metavante the "Termination Fee" defined and computed in accordance with the table below.

The "Estimated Remaining Value" means the mathematical product of (a) the average monthly fee paid by Customer with respect to the Initial Services during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Effective Date of Termination, multiplied by (b) the number of unexpired whole months remaining between the Effective Date of Termination and the expiration of the Initial Term.

If Customer breaches the foregoing covenant, the same shall constitute a partial termination of this Agreement, and Customer shall pay Metavante the Termination Fee for the affected Service, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

To the extent any insurance coverage required under this Section is purchased on a "claims-made" basis, such insurance shall cover all prior acts of Metavante during the Term, and such insurance shall be continuously maintained until at least four (4) years beyond the expiration or termination of the Term, or Metavante shall purchase "tail" coverage, effective upon termination of any such policy or upon termination or expiration of the Term, to provide coverage for at least four (4) years from the occurrence of either such event.

Metavante currently maintains and, if available at a reasonable cost, Metavante shall continue to pay for, and maintain in full force and effect during the Term insurance as follows:

A. Workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance with limits to conform with the greater of the amount required by Wisconsin applicable state statutory law or one million dollars ($1,000,000) each accident, including occupational disease coverage;

E. Professional liability insurance (Errors and Omissions) with limits not less than three million dollars ($3,000,000) annual aggregate for all claims each policy year for computer programming and electronic data processing services.

In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section             16.a.v due to e-centives' acquisition by an Excite@Home Named             Competitor, or by an entity controlling or controlled by an             Excite@Home Named Competitor, e-centives shall transfer all of its             right, title and interest in and to the Payment-Eligible User Data             to Excite.

Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in         part, without the other party's written consent (which will not be         unreasonably withheld), except that no such consent will be required in         connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of all, or         substantially all, of such party's assets or capital stock.

Any attempt         to assign this Agreement other than as permitted above will be null and         void.

Revenue generated by the parties      from such activities shall not be shared but rather shall be retained by      the respective party to whom the Sponsorship tile(s) are allocated.

Excite@Home will pay e-centives *****% of net revenue (gross revenue           less $***** purchase price and cost of sales not to exceed *****% of           gross revenues) generated from sales of the e-centives packages.

In the event that Excite@Home delivers more than *****           Payment-Eligible General Program Member User Data records and/or more           than ***** Payment-Eligible Qualified Program Member User Data           records during the Term of the Agreement, e-centives will pay           Excite@Home, on a quarterly basis, *****% of net revenue (gross           revenue less direct third party commissions) generated from the           delivery of offers to any such excess Program Members.

The parties will share equally all revenue from the listing of paper           or local coupons in the Co-Branded Application.

This equal division of revenue shall not extend to any placement of           Untargeted Offers outside the Co-Branded Application.

Excite@Home and e-centives shall share equally all net revenue from           such offers, defined as gross revenue minus third-party serving           costs, which shall not exceed $0.01 per email piece delivered.

The parties will share equally all revenue from the sale of           Untargeted Offers sold for display in the Co-Branded Application.

To the extent           that Excite@Home elects in its sole discretion to purchase in excess           of $***** in e-centive packages during any quarter, any such excess           purchases shall constitute a credit which Excite@Home may apply           against its minimum purchase obligations in any subsequent quarter(s).

Notwithstanding the foregoing,           Excite@Home agrees that emails shall be sent at least once per month           to at least 50% of the Program Members with at least five (5)           merchant offers.

Throughput of all data being served directly to the end user shall be           sustained at least 50Kbits/sec as measured by Excite@Home's monitoring           stations in at least 80% of all monitored cases.

Excite@Home will purchase in bulk a minimum of $3.75 million in           e-centive packages from e-centives at the rate of $***** per e-centive           delivered for the purpose of resale to Excite@Home's advertisers and           partners. Within 5 days of Launch Date Excite@Home will pay e-centives           a non-refundable minimum of $***** and will continue to pay a           minimum of $***** each quarter, payable at the beginning of the           quarter, during the Term of this Agreement for such packages.

The minimum of three offers per category must remain fresh;         if more than one week has elapsed without new offers being available         then a status message indicating no new offers in the category selected         will appear.

Excite@Home will supply to Application Provider a minimum of                ***** Payment-Eligible User Data records for General Program                Members containing all available information set forth in Section                1(h)  [DEFINITIONS] in each quarter during the Term of this Agreement, beginning                with the quarter in which the Launch Date (as hereinafter                defined) falls, for a minimum of ***** of these General                Program Member User Data records during the Term of this                Agreement.

At its discretion, Excite@Home may include up to five rotating links on         the My Excite Start Page ("MESP").

In the event that the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section             16.a.v due to e-centives' acquisition by an Excite@Home Named             Competitor, or by an entity controlling or controlled by an             Excite@Home Named Competitor, e-centives shall transfer all of its             right, title and interest in and to the Payment-Eligible User Data             to Excite.

In the event that the Agreement expires or is terminated for any

reason other than termination pursuant to Section 16.a.v, the                parties shall continue to jointly own Payment-Eligible User Data                in accordance with Section 6.a.

Transactional Data, when available, shall be jointly owned by                the parties, except in those cases where Application Provider's                contractual agreement(s) with its merchant partner(s) prevent                the sharing of said Transactional Data with third parties.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Payment-Eligible User Data             that relates to users who have opted out in accordance with Section             5(a) of EXHIBIT D shall continue to be jointly owned by the parties.

Each party hereby grants to the other a non-exclusive, limited license           to use its trademarks, service marks or trade names only as           specifically described in this Agreement.

In no event may either party sell, disclose, transfer, rent, or             license Payment-Eligible User Data to the other party's Named             Competitors as listed in EXHIBIT E. Furthermore, Excite@Home may not             sell, disclose, transfer, rent, or license Shopping Category Data or             Superset Data to Data Restricted Named Companies as specified in             EXHIBIT I. Not more than once per quarter, Application Provider may             update the list of Application Provider Data Restricted Named             Companies shown in EXHIBIT I, so long as such list shall not exceed             twenty-five (25) companies.

continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon.

       ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives.

       iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.

       iv)  Any such communications will be subject to Excite@Home's                then-current privacy policy.

Effects of Termination

iii) For a period of up to sixty (60) days, Application Provider will           provide consulting services to Excite@Home, as Excite@Home may           reasonably request and for reasonable fees to be paid to Application           Provider, such fees to be agreed upon in writing by the Parties, to           assist Excite@Home in providing a seamless transition to Program           Members. Application Provider will have no obligation to provide such           services to Excite@Home to the extent that Application Provider's           personnel and resources are unavailable in the amounts requested by           Excite@Home or if the Parties are unable in good faith to agree on the           reasonable fees to be paid to Application Provider for such services.           Application Provider will not be required, in the course of providing           such consulting services to Excite@Home, to disclose or transfer to           Excite@Home any proprietary information, software, or Intellectual           Property of Application Provider or any of its merchant partners.

To further ensure a seamless transition for Program Members, in the           event of a termination based upon a material breach by e-centives or           an acquisition pursuant to Section 16.a.v. only, Application Provider           shall continue to host and maintain the Co-Branded Application for a           period of one hundred twenty (120) days following either receipt or           issuance of notice of intention to terminate this Agreement. Such           hosting and maintenance of the Co-Branded Application shall be           provided by Application Provider at such reasonable rates as are           mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows:

       i)   Excite@Home will email Program Members on e-centives' behalf up                to a maximum of two times. Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will

Once every 12 months, the         party receiving payment and/or User Data records or its designee may         inspect such records to verify for accuracy.

Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and      (b)(iii)(3):

  a)   Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct           damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any           special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach           of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not           that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

  b)   Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts           actually paid by the other party.

Except as provided by Sections 19(a)(iii)(2), (a)(iii)(3), (b)(iii)(2) and      (b)(iii)(3):

  a)   Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct           damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any           special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach           of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not           that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

We will not exercise a right of first refusal with respect to a proposed Transfer of less than a controlling interest to a member of a Principal Owner's immediate family or to your key employees.

If the proposed Transfer includes assets not related to the operation of the Franchise, we may purchase only the assets related to the operation of the Franchise or may also purchase the other assets

Accordingly, neither this Agreement nor any part of your interest in it, nor any Interest (as defined in Paragraph 14.2) of Franchise Owner or a Principal Owner, may be transferred (see definition below) without our advance written approval if such transfer will result in the Principal Owner(s) set forth in Exhibit 4 holding less than a seventy-five percent (75%) Interest in Franchise Owner.

If you propose to Transfer this Agreement, the Franchise or its assets, or any Interest, or if any of your Principal Owners proposes to Transfer a controlling Interest in you or make a Transfer that is one of a series of Transfers which taken together would constitute the Transfer of a controlling Interest in you, then all of the following conditions must be met before or at the time of the Transfer:   (a) the Proposed New Owner must have sufficient business experience, aptitude, and financial resources to operate the Franchise;   (b) you must pay any amounts owed for purchases from us and our affiliates, and any other amounts owed to us or our affiliates which are unpaid;   (c) the Proposed New Owner's directors and such other personnel as we may designate must have successfully completed our Initial Training program, and shall be legally authorized and have all licenses necessary to perform the services offered by the Franchise. The Proposed New Owner shall be responsible for any wages and compensation owed to, and the travel and living expenses (including all transportation costs, room, board and meals) incurred by, the attendees who attend the Initial Training program;   (d) if your lease for the Premises requires it, the lessor must have consented to the assignment of the lease of the Premises to the Proposed New Owner;   (e) you (or the Proposed New Owner) must pay us a Transfer fee equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the then current initial franchise fee we charge to new Start-up Location franchisees, and must reimburse us for any reasonable expenses incurred by us in investigating and processing any Proposed New Owner where the Transfer is not consummated for any reason;   (f) you and your Principal Owners and your and their spouses must execute a general release (in a form satisfactory to us) of any and all claims you and/or they may have against us, our affiliates, and our and our affiliates' respective officers, directors, employees, and agents;

If you have transferred your Interests in violation of this Agreement you shall be considered in breach of this Agreement.

Any Transfer that is made without our approval will constitute a breach of this Agreement and convey no rights to or interests in this Agreement, you, the Franchise, or any other The Joint Corp. franchise.

Location franchise, and shall have agreed to pay our expenses for plan preparation or review, and site inspection;   (l)  upon receiving our consent for the Transfer or sale of the Franchise, the Proposed New Owner shall agree to assume all of your obligations under this Agreement in a form acceptable to us, or, at our option, shall agree to execute a new Franchise Agreement with us in the form then being used by us.

This Agreement may be terminated by Nexstar by written notice to WYZZ (i) any time upon six (6) months prior notice, (ii) on six (6) months prior notice following the sale of WYZZ-TV by WYZZ, and/or (iii) if Nexstar is not then in material default or breach hereof, and WYZZ is in material breach of its representations or its material obligations hereunder, and has failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice from Nexstar; provided, no notice may be given pursuant to clause (i) of this section prior to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Effective Date.

Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or in the event that either Party sells or otherwise transfers its Station to another (in which case such Party shall be required to assign to the Buyer, and such Buyer shall be required to assume, this Agreement, in its entirety), neither Party hereto shall assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement to a third party without the express written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, WYZZ shall continue to be the owner of and shall be entitled to all revenues resulting from the sale of advertising and other time on WYZZ-TV before, during and/or after the Term; provided, however, in consideration of the Services, Nexstar shall be entitled to all revenues resulting from the sale of advertising and other time on the Stations during the Term remaining after the payment of the amounts set forth below:

            (a) Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that "BCF" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month. Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month; provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%).

The Minimum BCF shall be Three Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,700,000) for calendar year 2002 and shall be increased on January 1, 2003 and on each January 1 thereafter in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Philadelphia Regional Office - All Urban Consumers for the United States - All Items) (the "PI") over the prior year.

During the Term, Nexstar shall calculate BCF (the "BCF Report") for each calendar month. The last day of each calendar month is referred to herein as an "End Date". During the Term, Nexstar shall, within thirty (30) days of each End Date deliver to WYZZ-TV the BCF Report for the month ending on such End Date. Within ninety (90) days following each

                                       3

calendar year during the Term, Nexstar shall notify WYZZ of the BCF for such year (the "Final BCF Report") and, subject to clause (h) of this Section 2, within thirty (30) days after such notification either Nexstar shall make a payment to WYZZ or WYZZ shall make a payment to Nexstar, as appropriate to "true-up" the payments made hereunder based on (i) the final determination of the BCF for the entire year, and (ii) the principle that the aggregate Section 2(a) Amount for the calendar year should be equal to (x) thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such calendar year up to the Minimum BCF for such year, plus (y) fifty percent (50%) of BCF for such calendar year in excess of the Minimum BCF for such year, minus (z) the sum of one hundred percent (100%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is owned by WYZZ or which is used solely in connection with the operation of WYZZ-TV, and fifty percent (50%) of any costs incurred by Nexstar during such calendar year in maintaining, replacing or purchasing capital equipment which is not owned by WYZZ and which is used in connection with the combined operation of both Stations (in each case to the extent such costs were not otherwise deducted in the calculation of BCF).

Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that "BCF" (as defined below) for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is less than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of BCF for such month. Within seventy-five (75) days following the end of each month of a calendar year during the Term that BCF for such month, when combined with BCF for all prior months of such calendar year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is greater than the Minimum BCF, Nexstar shall pay a fee to WYZZ in an amount equal to 50% of BCF for such month; provided, in the first month of each calendar year in which this sentence applies, the fee with respect to the portion of BCF for such month which, when combined with BCF for all prior months during such year (other than any month which is outside the Term) is exactly equal to the Minimum BCF, shall equal thirty-five percent (35%) of such portion rather than fifty percent (50%).

If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, WYZZ may continue to use Nexstar's facility (to the extent of, and consistent with, the use immediately prior to the termination) for a period of six (6) months following the date of actual termination, without regard to any continuation which occurs as a result of the immediately succeeding sentence (the "Continuation Period").

At all times during the Term and for six (6) months following the termination of this Agreement, WYZZ shall have the right, upon prior written request to Nexstar, to review all of the books and records of Nexstar relating to the BCF Report and the Distributions.

In addition, in the event of a material breach by Nexstar of its obligations hereunder, WYZZ shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(a) hereof (except that WYZZ may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits).

In addition, in the event of a material breach by WYZZ of its obligations hereunder, Nexstar shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement and exercise its rights pursuant to Section 25(b) hereof (except that Nexstar may not assert consequential, special or punitive damages or any claim for lost profits).

Nexstar shall maintain replacement cost casualty and liability insurance and property insurance on all of its assets and properties used and useful in the operation of WMBD-TV, general liability insurance, workers compensation insurance, and broadcast liability insurance, all in such amounts and on such terms and conditions that are ordinary and customary in the broadcast industry and that are reasonably acceptable to WYZZ.

The Investor hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent that it may do so under applicable law: (a) any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at law which may be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance in any action brought against the Investor for specific performance of this Agreement by Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders, or for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders by a receiver or trustee appointed for any Borrower or in respect of all or a substantial part of any Borrower's assets under the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of any jurisdiction to which such Borrower is, or its assets are, subject, (b) all statutes of limitations as a defense to any action or proceeding brought against the Investor by the Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Lenders under this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (c) any right the Investor may have to require the Agent or the Lenders to proceed against the Borrowers (or any of them), proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Borrowers (or any of them), or pursue any other remedy in the Agent's or the Lenders' power to pursue, (d) any defense based on any claim that the Investor's obligations hereunder exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrowers under the Financing Agreement or the other Loan Documents

EFS and its affiliates conduct their activities, both relating to the Playboy Commerce Business and otherwise, in a way that does  not jeopardize the Playboy Marks or the reputation and image of any Playboy entity or activity.

If EFS desires to use  any other domain names or Internet locators/designators in connection with the Websites, Micro Sites or otherwise utilizing  PLAYBOY- or PLAYBOY-related marks, EFS shall so notify Client, which may at its sole discretion, choose to register the  same at its expense.

EFS agrees that it shall approach Licensees regarding any planned  EFS Produced Merchandise and give such Licensees a seven (7) day right of first refusal with respect to the design and  manufacture thereof, whereby EFS may set forth commercially reasonable requirements with respect to pricing, delivery and  product specifications.

In addition, EFS may not assign this Agreement without Client's consent to a competitor  of Client or any of Client's businesses.

Any purported transaction not specifically permitted under this Section 14.3 shall be null and void ab initio.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and all  rights and duties hereunder shall not, without the prior written consent of Client, in any manner be assigned, mortgaged, licensed,  or otherwise transferred or encumbered by EFS or by operation of law; provided, however, that EFS may assign this Agreement  to an acquirer of all or substantially all of its assets without Client's consent, but only in the event that in Client's reasonable  determination (a) key EFS management (as defined by Client at the time of acquisition) will remain indefinitely with EFS or  replacement management is reasonably acceptable to Client and no less experienced than those in place as of the Effective Date  hereof; (b) the acquirer can demonstrate to Client's reasonable satisfaction the availability of financial resources, and the ability  and intention, to

Accordingly, EFS agrees it will spend annually a minimum of ***** of Net  Website Sales (as defined below) on online marketing ("Online Marketing Budget").

EFS shall have the right to decrease the Catalog budget  below the ***** minimum only if EFS can demonstrate that online marketing activities yield a higher return-on-investment and  provided all such reduced dollars are then reinvested in online marketing spend over and above the minimum online marketing  commitment described in Section 4.2, below.

For the avoidance of  doubt, the Minimum Royalty is a minimum net sum from which no taxes or charges of any sort may be deducted.

EFS will commit to an annual Catalog budget equal to or greater than *****, which represents  ***** of the actual amount spent by Client on the Catalogs for 2007.

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue, unless terminated sooner in accordance with this Article VIII, until June 27, 2011 (the "Term").

The Term of this Agreement shall be extended for subsequent one year periods upon the mutual agreement of the parties, which agreement shall be set forth in writing (in which event a party that desires to so extend the Term of this Agreement shall notify the other party at least 120 days prior to the termination of this Agreement).

This Agreement will be construed under and in accordance with, and governed in all respects by, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including Article XIII hereof) and subject to Section 13.1 hereof, King shall not promote, market or distribute any product containing metformin hydrochloride as the sole active ingredient in the Territory during the Term of this Agreement, other than the Product.

Depomed agrees to grant and hereby grants to King an exclusive option (exercisable at King's sole discretion by providing written notice of intent at any time, but in no event later than 180 days after the Effective Date) to obtain an exclusive license in the Territory to certain of Depomed's proprietary drug delivery technology in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and any other active pharmaceutical ingredients (a "Combination Product License").

If King notifies Depomed in writing within 180 days after the Effective Date that King desires to exercise its option to obtain a Combination Product License, King and Depomed shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations regarding a definitive agreement providing for the Combination Product License, for a period of 60 days or such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing; and it is agreed that, as part of such good faith negotiations, the parties will discuss, for inclusion in any definitive agreement, appropriate non-compete obligations for each party with respect to any product containing metformin hydrochloride as an active pharmaceutical ingredient.

If Depomed and King fail to enter into an agreement for the Metformin Product Rights prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter into an agreement with a Third Party granting the Metformin Product Rights to a Third Party; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the Third Party than the terms and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed.

If King is interested in obtaining the Metformin Product Rights, it shall so notify Depomed in writing prior to the expiration of the Evaluation Period, and upon Depomed's receipt of such notice King and Depomed shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations, for a period of 30 days and such longer period as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing in the event the parties have made material progress in the negotiations (the "Negotiation Period"), regarding the commercially reasonable terms of an agreement pursuant to which King shall obtain the Metformin Product Rights.

If Depomed and King fail to enter into such a definitive agreement during such period, then Depomed shall thereafter have the right to negotiate and enter into one or more agreements with Third Parties related to Depomed's proprietary drug delivery technology in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and other active pharmaceutical ingredients; provided that, for a period of 6 months, any such agreement may not be on terms and conditions materially more favorable to the Third Party than the terms and conditions last offered by King prior to the termination of discussions with Depomed.

Depomed agrees to grant and hereby grants to King an exclusive option (exercisable at King's sole discretion by providing written notice of intent at any time, but in no event later than 180 days after the Effective Date) to obtain an exclusive license in the Territory to certain of Depomed's proprietary drug delivery technology in combination with both metformin hydrochloride and any other active pharmaceutical ingredients (a "Combination Product License").

Any attempted assignment without consent shall be void.

This Agreement and the rights granted herein shall not be assignable by either party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party.

Except pursuant to Section 16.9 or in connection with the use of Third Party Sales Representatives, King shall not assign, subcontract or otherwise transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the express written consent of Depomed, which consent may be withheld by Depomed in its sole discretion.

From and after the Promotion Commencement Date, King shall perform at least [***] PDEs per calendar year, with such amount prorated over the initial and final calendar years of the Term if either such year is a partial year.

Upon the third failure by King to meet the PDE Minimum during any six consecutive Agreement Quarters, Depomed shall have the right to [***] or demand that King shall cure such default in the same manner outlined in clause (i) above for the first such default.

In fulfilling its obligations under this Section 4.1(b), King will perform [***], as follows: King will perform no less than an average of [***], with such reach and frequency as the JCC determines as part of the Annual Plan each year.

In the event that King does not perform the PDE Minimum in any Agreement Quarter (the difference between such PDE Minimum and the number of PDEs actually conducted, the "PDE Shortfall"), King will have until the end of the Agreement Quarter immediately following to cure its failure by providing a sufficient number of excess PDEs in the immediately following Agreement Quarter.

If King does not perform, in the aggregate, two times the PDE Minimum in any two consecutive Agreement Quarters, Depomed may demand that King cure such default by (A) [***] and (B) [***], in each case, prior to the end of the next succeeding Agreement Quarter following notice from Depomed.

King agrees that from and after the Promotion Commencement Date, the King Sales Force will be staffed with at least [***] full-time Sales Representatives (subject to vacancies consistent with average vacancy rate experienced by King across its total sales force) who are actively promoting the Product in accordance with the Launch Plan or Annual Plan (the "Minimum Sales Force Level"); provided that King may meet such requirement to actively promote the Product by promoting the Product through P2 Details and P3 Details.
